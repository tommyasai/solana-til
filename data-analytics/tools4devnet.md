The Result of My Quick Research on Data Analysis Tools for Solana (Devnet)

# Dune
Query Language: SQL (PostgreSQL)
## Pros
- Great UI to make nice dashboards
- Several kinds of charts can be created
- Low catch up cost as it's the most common tool

## Cons
- No Solana Devnet Support

# BitQuery
Query Language: GraphQL
## Pros
- Widely Used and support lots of chains
## Cons
- No Devnt support
- Cannot create beautiful dashboards like Dune

# Vybe Network
Query Language: GraphQL (VybeQL)  
Solana specific data and infrastructure provider
## Pros
- Got $10.5M invenstment by FTX this month

- UI is simple and easy to understand
## Cons
- Out of box charts/dashboards is not avaliable (Only indexing)
- We should build UI for the dashboard by ourseleves
- Relatively new and not widely used (Only about 300 members in its Discord server)
  
# Aleph
Query Language: GraphQL (VybeQL)
## Pros

## Cons
- This is rather a tool for development (like a firebase in Web2), not specialized for data analytics
- Out of box charts/dashboards is not avaliable (Only indexing)
